Here are some tips on how to deal with adult ADHD:\\n\\n### Understand and accept your diagnosis\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nThe first step in managing adult ADHD is to understand and accept your diagnosis. This means recognizing the symptoms and how they impact your daily life, and being willing to seek help and support.\\n\\n### Create a routine and structure\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nIndividuals with ADHD often benefit from a structured routine, as it can help them stay organized and focused. This can include creating a daily schedule, setting reminders, and breaking large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.\\n\\n### Use reminders and alerts\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nReminders and alerts can be a helpful tool for individuals with ADHD, as they can help them stay on track and remember important tasks and appointments. This can include setting reminders on a phone or computer, or using a planner or calendar to keep track of important dates and deadlines.\\n\\n### Practice time management skills\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nIndividuals with ADHD can benefit from practicing time management skills, such as prioritizing tasks, setting deadlines, and taking breaks to help stay focused. This can also involve learning to say \"no\" to non-essential tasks and commitments, and learning to delegate tasks when possible.\\n\\n### Use technology to your advantage\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nThere are many technology tools and apps available that can help individuals with ADHD manage their symptoms and stay organized. This can include tasks management apps, browser extensions that help block distracting websites, and apps that provide reminders and alerts.\\n\\n### Exercise regularly\\n-------------------------\\n\\nExercise has been shown to have a positive impact on ADHD symptoms, and can help individuals with ADHD stay focused and motivated. This can include finding an activity that you enjoy, such as running, swimming, or yoga, and making it a regular part of your routine'"
